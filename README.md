tsdn_v1.1

Version 1.1 of The Sound Decisions Network.

The developers at Sound Decisions decided to create this website so they can add some functionality they have created and use everyday to an actual website they can connect to where ever they happen to be.

It all started with a way to save website links and the usernames and passwords needed to access some of them.

Next we added the ability to add notes.

Then we had some fun and added a section for Movies which will be removed soon to replace the existing version of My Movie Collection.

A Recipes section was added not only to keep track of some recipes but to be able to add notes for a recipe to indicate variations such as the difference between cooking a 3 lb Roast and and a 5 lb Roast.

We will add more functionalty as we create it.
