			<p>Have you ever been at work or at a buddy's place and you want to visit a website and you just can't remember what the link is or even the name.  
				It's saved on your laptop or your home computer but you just don't have access to it where you happen to be.  
				The Links Section of <strong>The Sound Decisions Network</strong> was created for just this situation.</p>  
			<p>In addition to that though you can save your Username/Email and Password needed to access the site so you will never forget what it is.</p>
