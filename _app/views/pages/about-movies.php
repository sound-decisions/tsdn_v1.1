			<p>A few us here at <strong>Sound Decisions</strong> have rather large Movie Collections.  
				To keep track of them and to organize things we decdied to create a section of <strong>The Sound Decisions Network</strong> to handle this.</p>
			<p>As we come up with features and have the time to add them we well.  
				For instance, we often have Movie Night.  How do you decide what to watch?  
				What we have come up with is that everyone in our group can have a Watch List which is filled with movies we want to see.  
				Then we can create a Movie Group or something along those lines which will create a list of Movies that we all happen to have on our Watch List.  
				Then we can make a choice between all of the movies in that list.</p>
