			<p>After cleaning up our desk areas one day, we had the idea of adding a Notes Section to The Sound Decisions Network so we can add notes in one locations and have access to them where ever we happen to be.  
				With Search capabilites we can not only look through Note Categories to find Notes we are looking for but we can also search for the actual content we are looking for.  
				Now you don't need to keep Post It Notes or Sheets of Paper all over the place with various notes on them.  
				You can store them on The Sound Decisions Network and you have access to them from anywhere you have an Internet Connection.</p>
