			<p>Oddly enough, serveral of us at Sound Decisions are Bachelors, which means we have to cook for ourselves.  
				This means that we need a bunch of recipes that are easy to follow and we know will work.  
				This is not the normal Recipe Website which there are already many to chose from.  
				What we have created is more of a log type of Recipe Website where we can make notes on the recipes that we have used so we can perfect them as well as have different versions of.  
				For instance, when it comes to making a Roast, there is a time difference between cooking a 2 LB Roast and an a 5 LB Roast.  
				The concept is the same, it is just a different of time and or temperature.  
				Our Recipe Section allows you to enter notes based on a Recipe that you can indicate different times as well as what worked and what didn't.</p>
