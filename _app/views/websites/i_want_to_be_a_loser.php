					<p>We all know that losing weight isn't really a fun thing to do.  
						What if we could make it at least a little fun in some way?</p>
					<p>The <strong>I Want To Be A Loser</strong> website was created to make a game out of losing weight.</p>
					<p>Get a group of friends, family, co-workers, gym members or anybody together and setup a Weight Loss Challenge on <strong>I Want To Be A Loser</strong>.  
						You just need to come up with a Name for the Group and the Start and End Date for the Challenge.</p>
					<p>Each Group Member will enter their Starting Weight and the Goal Weight they hope to achieve by the end of the Challenge.    
						Don't worry, nobody but you will ever see your actual weight.  
						Your Group Members will only see how much weight you have lost and the percentage of your goal you have acheieved.</p>
					<p>Fill out progress reports on a regualr basis, we recommend once a week on the same day.  
						Personally, when I have done a Challenge I add my progress reports every Friday, that way, if I happen to cheat a little over the weekend, I have a whole week to make up for it.  
						The progress reports can be private so only you can see it or you can let your Group Members look at them.  
						Once again, nobody but you will ever be able to see your actual weight.</p>
