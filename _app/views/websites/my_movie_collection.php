					<p>Do you have a large Movie Collection that keeps getting more and more difficult to keep track of and organize?  
						Would it be handy to be able display a list of all the movies you have in your collection so you can pick one to watch or not buy one you already have?  
						When you and your friends and/or family get together to watch a movie, is it difficult to figure out what to watch?  
						If you answered yes to any of these questions then 'My Movie Collection' might be for you.</p>
					<p>This website was created because I had an every growing Movie Collection and I stored them in those big DVD Books.  
						It didn't make sense to store them alphabetically because I would have to move them all around everytime I added a new Move to my Collection.  
						So I store them by Index Number.  
						When I get a new Movie I just add it to the next available slot in one of my DVD Books, indicate that I have the Movie on the 'My Movie Collection' website which automatically asigns the next available Index Number, and I'm done.</p>
					<p>When I want to watch I movie I simply look it up on the 'My Movie Collection' website, get the Index Number, find the DVD Book that contains that Index Number and I have the Movie in hand.</p>
					<p><strong>This site is over 8 years old at the moment and is in the process of being completely updated.  
						Once the update is complete, this older version will be kept available for set period of time so you can make sure your Collection is properly setup in the new site.</strong></p>
