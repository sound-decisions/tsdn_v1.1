					<p>If so, why not create your own Pool and have a bunch of your friends, family, co-workers or whoever join it - OR - you can join someone elses Pool.  
						All you need is the Pool Name and Password.</p>
					<p>Every Game for the Season will already be entered so all you have to do is make sure to make your picks on time.</p>
					<p>We highly recommend that as soon as you join a Pool that you go through the whole Season and make all of your Picks.  
						Then just change them from Week to Week.  
						If you don't get your Picks in on time they depending on how the Pool was setup, you will receive 0, 1 less than the lowest correct or all visiting teams.</p>
					<p>We will update the Scores as the games finish and update the Pool Standings when it makes sense to.</p>
					<p><strong>This website has been up and running for over 6 years now and needs an update, which we are working on at the moment.  
						We hope to have the new version available for the 2014/2015 NFL Season.</strong></p>
